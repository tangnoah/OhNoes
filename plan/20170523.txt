1. Work towards MVP
	a. Create generic abstract Ship class
		i. Implement tree structure for Ship components
		ii. Implement methods for ship-to-ship combat and movement
	b. Create one working subclass for type of Ship
	c. Create a main game class which contains the action queue and all the ship instances
	d. Add a basic text interface that allows for control of the elements of the game without embellishment

2. Use Processing to create a graphical interface

3. Add extra features and interesting elements
